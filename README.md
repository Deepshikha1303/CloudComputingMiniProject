# Documentation of the api

This is a RESTful service that uses an external API, which contains the famous jokes involving Chuck Norris. First service is a GET and POST method in which we are fetching the data from external API and inserting it into the database, as well as sending and displaying it to the client, this functionality doesn't require any request parameter. Second and third methods are both GET, where we are getting all the data avilable in our database and a particular row respectively, the latter one needs a request parameter ID which is used to get the particular joke from the database. Furthermore, fourth method involves PUT method which is used to update the data inside our table called data which is inside the keyspace jokes, this method also required ID, as well as joke parameters to be passed with the URL. Lastly, Another method that we've used is DELETE, it takes ID as a request and deletes the row associated with that specific ID. These functionalities, when combined together form the CRUD operation.
